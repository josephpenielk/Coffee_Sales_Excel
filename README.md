# Coffee Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Coffee Sales Data Analysis project! This project shows how I used Excel to analyze coffee sales. I used different Excel functions like XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and IF to understand the data better. The main aim is to create a dashboard that gives useful insights into coffee sales.

## Data Source

The data comes from Kaggle. You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/coffee-bean-sales-raw-dataset/data).

## Project Structure

### Data Manipulation

I used Excel formulas like XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and IF to change the raw sales data into useful information.

### Pivot Table and Charts

I made a pivot table to summarize the data and created charts in Excel. This helps in making an interactive dashboard.

### Interactive Dashboard

I made a dashboard with charts that show total sales over time, top 5 customers, and sales by country. You can use slicers to filter data based on dates, roast type (dark, medium, light), package size (0.2KG, 0.5KG, 1.0KG), and customer loyalty.

### Data Formatting

I made sure the data and charts look clear and nice by formatting them properly.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes:

- **Total Sales Over Time:** A chart showing sales trends.
  
- **Top 5 Customers:** A chart highlighting the top 5 customers.

- **Sales by Country:** A map showing sales in different countries.

- **Slicers for Interactivity:** Use slicers to filter data and see specific details.



### How to Test:

1. **Download the Excel File:** Click on (`coffeeOrdersData.xlsx`) and then click "Download".

2. **Open the Excel File:** Open it using Microsoft Excel after downloading.

3. **Explore the Interactive Dashboard:** See how the charts change when you use slicers.

4. **Give Feedback:** If you have ideas or find issues, [create an issue](https://github.com/your-username/Coffee-Sales-Analysis/issues). Your thoughts are important!
